"""Compaction hidden behind Codex's queued-inputs block (2026-10-09 01:15 +0800).

Measured with EXECUTOR_READY_73c025c0: the supervisor was compacting while an
earlier ask (ff5ade80) sat in "• Queued follow-up inputs". The status region
took that queue header as the latest status bullet, so every compaction gate
passed; the bridge pasted and pressed Enter into a compacting receiver and the
payload stayed in the composer. The same screens showed the header-blind queue
detector calling the genuinely queued ff5ade80 "not queued".
Fixtures are the journal's PASTE_INTENT / POST_ENTER screens, sanitized.
