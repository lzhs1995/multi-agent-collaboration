# `SKILL.md` states that `cmux-agent ask` and `cmux_bridge.submit_text` implement
# the same delivery-proof contract in both directions. They are two separate
# implementations of one detector, in two languages, and only one of them is
# inside this skill. Fixing the Python copy therefore does not fix the callback
# path an executor actually uses -- measured: `~/.local/bin/cmux-agent`
# is a bash script whose `prompt_block_pending` still matches only Claude's
# ``❯`` and still treats an earlier transcript block as live compose.
#
# This gate cannot repair that file (it is outside the task pack), so it does the
# next best thing: it runs the helper's own function, byte-for-byte, against the
# same fixtures as the in-scope module and reports divergence as a finding. A
# second implementation nobody compares is how one copy silently rots.
