# Receiver input and delivery evidence

Current delivery and recovery rules are defined in
[verified native delivery](verified-compose-delivery.md). Screen inspection protects
input ownership; only the original bound native record proves reception.

Before every agent message, read the bound UUID's current screen. `submit_text`
requires a current agent composer/provider footer or its observed empty prompt.
A bare zsh/bash/PowerShell prompt after agent exit overrides historical agent
output. A fancy shell prompt sharing an agent glyph remains UNKNOWN without
current UI evidence. SHELL/UNKNOWN send no text or keys; force-compose does not
bypass this check. Inspect the original session rather than replacing it.

The provider footer must belong to the bottom input area; unknown trailing
content overrides a stale footer or virtual suggestion. During authorized
compose clearing, recheck receiver type and active/queued work after every
screen read before sending another key. If the agent exits after Escape,
no subsequent clear, cancel or deletion key may reach the shell.

The low-level `send_text` is raw terminal input and is not an agent dispatch API.
Use it for a shell command only when that exact shell action is authorized and
the receiver is verified. Running a shell command does not restore a model TUI.

| Evidence | Meaning | Next action |
|---|---|---|
| Recorded zero-input refusal | Not submitted | Resolve the original receiver/input issue |
| Paste or key with no native proof | Unconfirmed | Preserve the original attempt; do not resend |
| UI queue or Claude `queued_command` | Pending, not received | Bounded read-only observation of the same attempt |
| New exact native user after original PASTE_INTENT EOF fence | `NATIVE_RECEIVED` | Record reception; execution/acceptance remain separate |
| Reply/ACK | Response or channel possession | Read the actual verdict; not delivery or agreement proof |
| Frozen report | Report available | Supervisor independently verifies scope and artifacts |

`DISPATCH_UNCONFIRMED` or helper exit 75 is not evidence of non-delivery.
Preserve the original observation even if a later exact native record permits
reconciliation. Unknown/queued attempts are not repasted. A complete stable
original draft may use only the original controller's one shared additional-key
budget; recovery intentions consume it before input. There is no separate Tab
allowance. Missing original binding/fence cannot be added retrospectively.

The first submission uses Tab directly only when busy Codex explicitly displays
the supported `tab to queue message` action and the full draft matches; other
clear supported states use Enter. A queue entry remains pending. Screen activity,
prompt echo, empty compose, ACK or a marker alone cannot confirm reception.

An occupied composer is preserved by default; explicitly authorized force-compose
still cannot clear active/queued work. Future UI shapes need a measured fixture
and an updated detector; a historical screenshot is not current liveness.

Tests use synthetic screens and count actual mocked send/key calls. They verify
zero sends to a shell, preserved user input, one paste for queued delivery, and
the distinction between current and historical UI. They do not certify another
terminal, restart a peer or change its model. Cross-agent review records who
actually responded; unavailable peers' old evidence is not new consensus.

## 2026-10-05: Suggestion-like text preserves draft ownership

Screen text alone cannot distinguish a product suggestion from a typed draft. Treat visible `continue`, `/compact`, review requests and handshake suggestions as occupied, including with an auto-compact banner. Only an actually empty editor or the exact standard empty placeholder passes the empty-editor predicate. Preserve the first typed row and payload bullets; trim recognized footer rows only. Normal dispatch must refuse with zero paste/key operations. This source regression fix does not authorize force clearing or imply a running client has reloaded.
